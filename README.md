# Gauge-Fixed-3D-Bacon-Shor-Code
Decodes a gauge fixed version of the 3D Bacon-Shor Code under Erasure and Depolarizing noise channels.
We modify the peeling decoder to decode the resulting stabilizer code under the erasure noise channel for 4 distances(5,7,9, and 11).
We use the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching Decoder to decode it under the depolarizing noise channel for 4 distances(5,9,13 and 17).
